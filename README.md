## Variable Selection: What your model can't tell you

Here you can find the slides and relevant Python files for my presentation in Vilnius. The abstract can be found below. The recording can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZSSA7Qdggs

#### Variable selection is often left up to an algorithm. However, controlling for some variables can improve measurement accuracy, and thus overall performance. On the other hand, certain "bad" controls can block pathways of relationships between variables that we want to preserve or create spurious correlations. Using real and simulated data, I explain when to reconsider your controls, and why that may significantly improve model accuracy.

Econometricians spend a lot of time thinking about causality, whereas data science generally focuses more on prediction and classification. But is there something to be learned from economists' fixation on causal relationships?
